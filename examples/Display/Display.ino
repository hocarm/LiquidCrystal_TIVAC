  LiquidCrystal Library - display() and noDisplay()

 Demonstrates the use a 16x2 LCD display.  The LiquidCrystal
 library works with all LCD displays that are compatible with the
 Hitachi HD44780 driver. There are many of them out there, and you
 can usually tell them by the 16-pin interface.

 This sketch prints "Hello World!" to the LCD and uses the
 display() and noDisplay() functions to turn on and off
 the display.

 The circuit:
 * LCD VCC - 5V
 * LCD GND - GND
 * LCD R/W - GND
 * LCD RS - PD1
 * LCD EN - PD2
 * LCD D4 - PD3
 * LCD D5 - PE1
 * LCD D6 - PE2
 * LCD D7 - PE3
 * 10K resistor:
 * ends to +5V and ground
 * wiper to LCD VO pin (pin 3)
